# Meeko - A Learning-Focused Social Media Platform

Meeko is an open-source social media platform built with Next.js, designed to be a learning resource for developers interested in understanding modern web development practices, authentication flows, and social media features. This project intentionally contains some bugs and suboptimal practices to serve as a learning opportunity for developers to identify and fix common issues in web applications.

## üéØ Purpose

Meeko serves multiple purposes:
- A practical example of a modern social media platform implementation
- A learning resource for identifying and fixing common web development issues
- A playground for experimenting with different web development patterns
- A starting point for developers to understand authentication, real-time updates, and social features

## üöÄ Features

- User authentication (Email & Google Sign-in)
- Personalized story feed
- Story creation and sharing
- User profiles
- Real-time updates
- Responsive design
- Dark/Light mode support

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **State Management**: React Context
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **AI Integration**: Google's Gemini AI

## üêõ Known Issues & Learning Opportunities

This project intentionally contains several issues and suboptimal practices that serve as learning opportunities:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Inconsistent navigation after sign-in
   - Potential race conditions in auth state management
   - Cookie management improvements needed

2. **State Management**
   - Over-reliance on context for global state
   - Potential performance issues with frequent re-renders
   - Missing proper loading states

3. **Code Organization**
   - Inconsistent file structure
   - Mixed usage of client and server components
   - Missing proper error boundaries

4. **Performance**
   - Unoptimized image loading
   - Missing proper caching strategies
   - Potential memory leaks in real-time listeners
